## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(openintro)
loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  select(loan_amount, interest_rate, term, grade, 
         state, annual_income, homeownership, debt_to_income)
glimpse(loans)

ggplot(loans, aes(y = homeownership,
                  fill = grade)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(
    x = "Highest Degree",
    y = "Drug Types",
    fill = "Highest Degree",
    title = "To examine if a certain gender has an inclination for drug abuse",
    subtitle = "with some additional factors"
  )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
